This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in Rust: using raw pointers to modify data structures that might reallocate.  The example code modifies a vector through a raw pointer after the vector's internal storage might have been moved, leading to undefined behavior.  The solution demonstrates how to avoid this by using safe abstractions or other techniques that do not rely on raw pointers for mutation operations.
